# Sketch App

## Overview

Sketch App is a drawing and sketching application built using Flutter's low-level features such as `CustomPaint` and `CustomPainter` class. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for artists and designers to create digital sketches and illustrations.

## Features

1. **Canvas**: Sketch App offers a blank canvas where users can freely draw and create their artwork using various drawing tools.

2. **Drawing Tools**: The application includes a set of basic drawing tools such as brushes, pencils, and erasers. These tools provide different stroke styles, sizes, and colors to enhance creativity and expressiveness.

3. **CustomPaint and CustomPainter**: Sketch App utilizes Flutter's `CustomPaint` widget and `CustomPainter` class to create a custom drawing area. This allows for low-level control over the drawing process, enabling smooth and responsive sketching experience.

4. **Layers**: The app supports a layer-based approach, allowing users to work on different elements of their artwork independently. Users can create and manage multiple layers, enabling easy editing and manipulation of individual elements.

5. **Color Picker**: Sketch App includes a basic color picker tool that allows users to select colors from a predefined palette. Users can choose different colors to create vibrant and diverse illustrations.
